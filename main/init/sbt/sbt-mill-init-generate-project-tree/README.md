An sbt plugin to generate the project tree for `mill init`

## Working on this project

Make sure you are on the SNAPSHOT version of Mill,
and run `./mill "main.init.sbt.models[2.12.20].publishLocal"`,
to publish the models to Ivy's local repository before working on this project.
Then open this directory as a separate IntelliJ IDEA project as this is an sbt project.
